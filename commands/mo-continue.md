description: Universal advancement signal for the mo-workflow. Dispatches to the right handler for the current state — pre-flight (after marking todos / approving blueprints), post-chain resume, overseer-review, or post-review-session resume.
---

# mo-continue

**The single advancement signal the overseer types throughout the workflow.** Reads `progress.md` (and a few sibling files) for the current state, decides where we are, and runs the appropriate handler.

The overseer types `/mo-continue` at every gate where they previously typed a free-form approval:

1. **After marking PENDING items** in the active cycle's `todo-list.md` (stage 1.5; lives under `quest/<active-slug>/todo-list.md`). Runs the Pre-flight Handler — promotes the marked items, analyzes feature dependencies, and proposes a workflow order.
2. **After accepting the proposed queue order** (stage 1.5, second invocation). Runs the Pre-flight Handler — writes the cycle's `queue-rationale.md`, reorders the queue, and auto-fires `/mo-apply-impact`.
3. **After reviewing the blueprint** (stage 2). Runs the Approve Handler — auto-fires `/mo-plan-implementation`.
4. **After the brainstorming chain has fully exited and returned control** (stage 3 → 4; the chain produced commits in `base-commit..HEAD`). Runs the Resume Handler — generates implementation diagrams and hands off to overseer review. **Do not type `/mo-continue` while the chain is mid-prompt** (e.g., while `finishing-a-development-branch` is asking for approval); answer the chain first.
5. **After writing findings into `overseer-review.md`** (stage 5; or leaving it empty to approve). Runs the Overseer Handler — auto-completes if there are no findings, or invokes `/mo-review` and returns control to the overseer.
6. **(only if findings were present)** **After the brainstorming review session has fully exited and returned control** (stage 6 → 7). Runs the Review-Resume Handler — offers a diagram refresh, sanity-checks findings, advances, and auto-fires `/mo-complete-workflow`. **Do not type `/mo-continue` while the review session is mid-prompt**; answer the chain first.

For any other workflow state, this command falls through to `/mo-resume-workflow` to give the overseer a state diagnosis instead of erroring out.

## Execution

### Step 1 — Read state

```bash
active_feature="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh get-active 2>/dev/null || echo 'null')"
queue_count="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh queue-remaining 2>/dev/null | sed '/^$/d' | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
# todo-list.md lives inside the active quest cycle's subfolder; resolve via quest.sh.
quest_dir="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/quest.sh dir 2>/dev/null || echo "")"
todo_file="$quest_dir/todo-list.md"
```

If `progress.md` (or `quest/active.md` / the active cycle subfolder) is missing, the calls fail — surface the error and stop (no recovery here; the overseer should run `/mo-run` first).

### Step 2 — Dispatch

The dispatcher picks a handler based on whether a feature is active and, when active, on `current-stage` + `sub-flow`. Pre-flight cases (no active feature) live above the table:

**Pre-flight cases (`active_feature == "null"`):**

Order matters — Rows A/B (auto-fire) must be evaluated **after** the manual-action rows (the overseer's `[x] TODO` and queue-rationale-missing signals take precedence over auto-fire) and **before** the catch-all (otherwise they'd never run). See Item 5 of the v11 progress-gap plan for the load-bearing rationale.

| Condition | Handler |
| --- | --- |
| `[x] TODO` lines exist in `todo-list.md` (selections not yet promoted) | **Pre-flight Step 2A** — promote + propose order |
| no `[x] TODO` lines, `queue_count > 0`, `queue-rationale.md` missing | **Pre-flight Step 2B** — confirm proposed order + auto-fire `/mo-apply-impact` |
| no `[x] TODO` lines, `queue_count > 0`, `queue-rationale.md` present, top-level `status: draft` (Item 7 multi-batch) | **Pre-flight Step 2B** (extended) — confirm/update the latest batch, refresh top-level `features:`/`batch:`, flip `status` to `confirmed`, auto-fire `/mo-apply-impact` |
| **Row A — between features:** active is null AND `queue_count > 0` AND `queue-rationale.md.status` (or absent → confirmed) is `confirmed` AND `(queue-rationale.md.features − progress.completed, preserving order)` equals `progress.queue` exactly | Auto-fire `/mo-apply-impact` |
| **Row B — post-finish housekeeping recovery:** active is null AND queue empty AND no `[x] TODO` AND no `[ ] TODO` AND `progress.completed` non-empty AND `blueprints/history/v[N]/reason.md.kind == "completion"` for `completed[-1]` AND `quest/active.md.status == "active"` | Auto-fire `/mo-complete-workflow` (short-circuits to its Branch I — Step 7 housekeeping only) |
| `queue_count == 0` and no `[x] TODO` lines (catch-all) | Delegate to `/mo-resume-workflow` |

**Active cases (`active_feature != "null"`):**

```bash
current_stage="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh get current-stage)"
sub_flow="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh get sub-flow)"
```

| Current stage | Sub-flow      | Handler                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2             | (any)         | **Approve Handler** — auto-fire `/mo-plan-implementation`     |
| 3             | (any)         | Post-chain resume (see Resume Handler below)                  |
| 5             | (any)         | Overseer-review received (see Overseer Handler below)         |
| 6             | reviewing     | Post-review-session resume (see Review-Resume Handler below)  |
| 7             | (any)         | Stage-7 finalize — auto-fire `/mo-complete-workflow` (Item 4 of v11 plan; idempotent via Branch II in mo-complete-workflow when re-entered after a partial finalize) |
| any other     | —             | Delegate to `/mo-resume-workflow` for state diagnosis         |

For the "any other" case (active or pre-flight), invoke `/mo-resume-workflow` and stop — let it report state and recommend the next command.

---

## Pre-flight Handler (active=null, queue or selections pending)

Runs at stage 1.5 — between `/mo-run` (which scaffolded the queue from journal content) and `/mo-apply-impact` (which will activate the first feature). Two sub-states, distinguished by what's still pending in the source files.

### Pre-flight Step 2A — Promote selections + propose order

Reached when the overseer has just finished marking items (`[x] TODO` lines exist).

1. **Promote the marked items.**
   ```bash
   $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh queue-remaining >/dev/null  # confirms progress.md exists
   $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/todo.sh pend-selected
   ```
   `pend-selected` rejects any `[x] TODO` line missing an `(assignee)` tag — relay the offenders to the overseer, ask for assignee names, and stop. The overseer fixes the file and re-types `/mo-continue`.
2. **Group PENDING items by feature.** Read `todo-list.md` and collect the set of feature section headings (`## <feature>`) that contain `[x] PENDING` lines.
3. **Detect the queue source state.**
   ```bash
   queue_count="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh queue-remaining 2>/dev/null | sed '/^$/d' | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
   ```
   - **If `queue_count > 0`:** the queue was seeded by `/mo-run` (initial cycle). It already lists every feature found in the journal, in some default order. Skip to step 5.
   - **If `queue_count == 0`:** mid-cycle re-entry (Finding 6 — the cycle's first batch already completed and the overseer is marking more items now). The queue must be repopulated from the freshly-PENDING feature names:
     ```bash
     $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh enqueue <feat1> [<feat2> ...]
     ```
     where `<featN>` is the de-duplicated set of feature headings that hold PENDING items in `todo-list.md`. `enqueue` refuses duplicates against `queue ∪ completed`, so a feature already finished in this cycle would error out — surface that to the overseer (they probably wrote a TODO under the wrong heading).
4. **Analyze codebase for cross-feature dependencies.** For ≥ 2 features in the queue, do a bounded inspection (grep for cross-feature imports, references in shared modules) to surface ordering hints. Skip when there's only one feature.
5. **Propose the prioritized order.** Print the order as a numbered list and the dependency reasoning underneath. End the message with:
   > "Reply `/mo-continue` to accept this order, or paste a different order (one feature per line) and then `/mo-continue` to confirm."
6. **Mid-cycle re-entry only — append a draft batch to `queue-rationale.md` (Item 7 of the v11 plan).** When this Step 2A run is the mid-cycle re-entry path (queue was empty + we just re-populated via `enqueue`), `queue-rationale.md` already exists from the prior cycle's batches and its top-level `status` is `confirmed`. Append a new `## Batch <N+1> — <today>` body with the proposed order in `### Order` (and `### Dependencies`/`### Notes` if applicable). Refresh top-level frontmatter atomically with the body write: `batch: N+1`, `status: draft`, `features: <previous confirmed cumulative + proposed order for new batch>`. This makes the next `/mo-continue` route to the draft-confirmation row in the dispatcher (Item 5) → Step 2B (extended) for confirmation.

   ```bash
   if [[ -f "$qr_file" && "$(frontmatter.sh get "$qr_file" status 2>/dev/null || echo confirmed)" == "confirmed" ]]; then
     # Determine N from the highest matched ## Batch <N> heading via the pinned regex
     # ^## Batch (\d+)\b. Files without batch headers are treated as implicit Batch 1.
     # Append ## Batch <N+1> — <today> + ### Order/Dependencies/Notes via Edit.
     # Then update top-level frontmatter:
     #   $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/frontmatter.sh set "$qr_file" batch <N+1>
     #   $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/frontmatter.sh set "$qr_file" status draft
     #   $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/frontmatter.sh set "$qr_file" features '[<cumulative>]'
   fi
   ```
7. **Stop.** Do NOT auto-fire Step 2B from here — the draft batch needs the overseer's explicit confirmation. The dispatcher routes the next `/mo-continue` to Step 2B (extended) automatically because top-level `status` is now `draft`.

   For the **initial cycle** (queue was already seeded by `/mo-run`, no prior batches exist): skip the file write here and let Step 2B's case (a) write the file from scratch when the overseer confirms. (This preserves the current behavior for fresh cycles.)

### Pre-flight Step 2B — Confirm order + auto-fire `/mo-apply-impact`

Reached when `[x] TODO` lines have been promoted (none remain) AND either (a) `queue-rationale.md` is missing OR (b) `queue-rationale.md` is present with `status: draft`. Item 5 of the v11 plan extends Step 2B to handle both cases — they share the prompt logic, the order-validation, the `progress.sh reorder` call, and the auto-fire of `/mo-apply-impact`. They diverge only at the file-write step (init vs. targeted edit).

**Detect entry condition:**

```bash
quest_dir="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/quest.sh dir)"
qr_file="$quest_dir/queue-rationale.md"
if [[ -f "$qr_file" ]]; then
  qr_status="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/frontmatter.sh get "$qr_file" status 2>/dev/null || echo 'confirmed')"
  qr_batch="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/frontmatter.sh get "$qr_file" batch 2>/dev/null || echo '1')"
else
  qr_status="missing"
  qr_batch="0"
fi
```

1. **Resolve the confirmed order.** If the overseer typed a custom order in the previous turn, parse it. Otherwise, use the proposal from Step 2A (which the millwright still has in conversation context — if the session was compacted, re-derive it by re-grouping PENDING items + re-running dependency analysis). For the draft case (b), the proposal lives in the latest batch's `### Order` body and in top-level `features:` (the suffix corresponding to the draft batch).
2. **Validate the order.** It must be a permutation of the current `progress.md` queue. If the overseer's custom order is malformed (extras, missing entries, duplicates), surface the error and ask them to retype.
3. **Write the cycle's `queue-rationale.md`.** Two sub-paths:

   **(a) Missing — write a fresh file** (current behavior):

   ```bash
   todo_list_id="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/frontmatter.sh get \
     "$quest_dir/todo-list.md" id)"
   $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/frontmatter.sh init queue-rationale \
     "$qr_file" \
     "TODO_LIST_ID=$todo_list_id" \
     "FEATURES=<comma-joined confirmed order>"
   ```

   Then fill the body via `Edit` per the template's section guide (one `## Batch 1 — <date>` section with `### Order`, `### Dependencies`, `### Notes`). Top-level `status` and `batch` may be omitted (schema defaults handle them as `confirmed`/`1`).

   **(b) Draft — targeted edit of the existing file** (Item 7 + Item 5 extension):

   - Update only the **latest batch's** `### Order / ### Dependencies / ### Notes` body to reflect the confirmed order and reasoning. Do NOT add a new batch (Item 7 reserves the append step for Step 2A); do NOT rewrite earlier batch bodies (audit history).
   - Refresh top-level `features:` to the cumulative ordered list across all batches (previous confirmed batches' features in order, plus the just-confirmed latest batch's features). Use `mo_fm_set` (via `frontmatter.sh set`) to preserve the rest of the frontmatter.
   - Set top-level `batch:` to the latest batch number (`qr_batch`).
   - Flip top-level `status:` from `draft` to `confirmed`.
   - **Load-bearing invariant:** after Step 2B returns, `queue-rationale.md.features - progress.completed` must equal `progress.queue` in order, or Row A will not fire between features. Verify this before the auto-fire below.

4. **Reorder the queue.**
   ```bash
   $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh reorder <feature1> <feature2> ...
   ```
5. **Auto-fire `/mo-apply-impact`.** Same as the prior end-of-stage-1.5 transition.

---

## Approve Handler (current-stage = 2)

Runs after the overseer has reviewed the blueprint files (`requirements.md`, `config.md`, `diagrams/`) and is ready to advance into the planning chain.

### Approve Step 1 — Sanity-check blueprint files

Use `blueprints.sh check-current` (default mode — `primer.md` is not expected until stage 3) so partial stage-2 generations cannot slip through to `/mo-plan-implementation` with an incomplete blueprint:

```bash
if "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/blueprints.sh" check-current "$active_feature"; then
  current_status=0
else
  current_status=$?
fi
case "$current_status" in
  0) ;;  # stage-2 blueprint is complete; proceed to /mo-plan-implementation
  1)
    echo "error: blueprints/current is empty for $active_feature; run /mo-apply-impact first" >&2
    exit 1
    ;;
  2)
    echo "error: blueprints/current is partial or invalid for $active_feature; repair it or re-run /mo-apply-impact before approving" >&2
    exit 1
    ;;
  *)
    echo "error: check-current returned unexpected status $current_status" >&2
    exit 1
    ;;
esac
```

The default mode is correct here: `primer.md` is written at stage 3 by `/mo-plan-implementation` Step 3.5, so it does not exist yet at the stage-2 approve gate. Stage-3+ callers (`/mo-update-blueprint`, the Stage-4 drift probe, `/mo-complete-workflow` before completion rotation) use `--require-primer` to also validate the primer.

### Approve Step 2 — Auto-fire `/mo-plan-implementation`

`/mo-plan-implementation` handles its own preconditions: branch validation against `config.md`'s `## GIT BRANCH`, todo promotion (PENDING → IMPLEMENTING), `base-commit` capture, primer composition, planning-mode prompt, and chain launch.

```bash
/mo-plan-implementation
```

If `mo-plan-implementation` errors (branch missing, branch mismatch, etc.), relay the error to the overseer; they fix the underlying issue and type `/mo-continue` again.

---

## Resume Handler (current-stage = 3)

Runs after the brainstorming chain has fully exited and returned control. Generates implementation diagrams (with pre-existing system framed as shaded context), optionally rotates the blueprint if requirements changed during brainstorming, and hands off to the overseer for review.

The handler is structured so re-runs after a session break are safe (Item 1 of the v11 progress-gap plan). All state writes are atomic, and a Step 0 drift-completion probe detects "drift was successfully completed in this cycle but the marker write was lost" without re-prompting the overseer.

### Resume Step 0 — Drift-completion probe (closes F1)

Skipped when `active.drift-check-completed` is already true (probe is gated to one-shot per cycle). Detects the case where `/mo-update-blueprint` rotated and regenerated successfully but the subsequent marker-set was lost to a session break — without this probe, the next `/mo-continue` would re-prompt the overseer for a drift decision they already answered.

```bash
data_root="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/data-root.sh)"
hist="$data_root/workflow-stream/$active_feature/blueprints/history"

drift_marker="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh get drift-check-completed 2>/dev/null || echo 'false')"

### Resume Step 1 — Verify the chain produced commits (zero-commit branch)

```bash
base_commit="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh get base-commit)"
commit_count="$(git rev-list --count "$base_commit..HEAD")"
```

**If `commit_count > 0`:** proceed to Step 2 (the normal flow).

**If `commit_count == 0`:** the chain produced no commits since `base-commit`. Three legitimate causes — prompt the overseer:

> "Stage 4 — no commits since `base-commit` (`$base_commit`). The brainstorming chain (or direct implementation) hasn't produced code yet. Reply:
>

```

In the happy path, the mo-workflow does **not** track or read the spec / plan files the chain produced under `docs/superpowers/` — those are the chain's own artefacts and `base-commit..HEAD` is the canonical implementation contract. Step 2.5 below is the single exception: when commits exist *and* a plan file from this chain run is detected, the handler reads the plan/spec **read-only** to compose a resume primer if the overseer reports the chain was interrupted mid-run.

### Resume Step 2 — Mark sub-flow + idempotent flag writes

Atomic batched write — these flags are idempotent on retry:

```bash
# Prompt for execution-mode only when not yet persisted (a prior partial run
# may have already chosen). Otherwise reuse the persisted value.
mode_persisted="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh get execution-mode 2>/dev/null || echo 'none')"
if [[ "$mode_persisted" == "none" ]]; then
  # Prompt the overseer (subagent-driven|inline). The exact prompt text lives
  # in Resume Step 3 below for narrative continuity.
  mode="$mode_from_overseer"  # placeholder; the LLM following this recipe asks the overseer.
else
  mode="$mode_persisted"
fi

$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh set \
  "implementation-completed=true" \
  "execution-mode=$mode" \
  "sub-flow=resuming"
```

### Resume Step 2.5 — Confirm chain completion (abandoned-chain recovery)

A session that was closed mid-chain looks identical to a clean exit at this point: both have commits in `base-commit..HEAD` and `sub-flow=chain-in-progress`. To distinguish, look for plan files written by *this* chain run and ask the overseer.

1. **Locate this run's plan candidates.** Combine plans added/modified in `base-commit..HEAD` (committed by the chain) with any plan files currently in the working tree under `docs/superpowers/plans/` (the chain may have written but not yet committed). Filtering by `base-commit..HEAD` excludes plans from earlier features.

   ```bash
   plan_candidates="$(
     {
       git log --diff-filter=AM --name-only --format= "$base_commit..HEAD" -- 'docs/superpowers/plans/*.md' 2>/dev/null
       git status --porcelain -- docs/superpowers/plans/ 2>/dev/null \
         | sed -E 's/^.. //; s/^.*-> //' \
         | grep '\.md$' || true
     } | sort -u
   )"
   ```

2. **If `plan_candidates` is empty** — no plan from this chain run was found (e.g., `planning-mode=direct` skips writing-plans, or the chain committed without dropping a plan file). Skip the recovery branch entirely and fall through to Step 3. No prompt; no behavior change versus the pre-recovery happy path.

3. **If `plan_candidates` has entries** — for each, count `- [x]` (done) and `- [ ]` (remaining) checkboxes:

   ```bash
   commit_count_total="$(git rev-list --count "$base_commit..HEAD")"
   last_commit="$(git log -1 --format='%h %s' HEAD)"
   while IFS= read -r plan; do
     [[ -z "$plan" ]] && continue
     done_count="$(grep -cE '^[[:space:]]*-[[:space:]]*\[[xX]\]' "$plan" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)"
     remaining_count="$(grep -cE '^[[:space:]]*-[[:space:]]*\[[[:space:]]\]' "$plan" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)"
     echo "$plan|$done_count|$remaining_count"
   done <<< "$plan_candidates"
   ```

4. **Prompt the overseer.** Render the candidates as a numbered list with their checkbox counts and ask:

   > "Stage 4 — chain-completion check.
   >
   > Plan file(s) written during this chain run:
   >
   >   1. `<path>` — done: N, remaining: M
   >   2. `<path>` — done: P, remaining: Q  *(only if multiple candidates)*
   >
   > Commits since base-commit: K (latest: `<sha> <subject>`)
   >
   > Did the brainstorming chain finish cleanly, or was the session interrupted mid-chain?
   >
   >   - `completed` — advance to overseer review (3 → 4). Use this when the chain ran through `finishing-a-development-branch` and exited normally; remaining `- [ ]` checkboxes are stale (the chain doesn't always tick the very last step).
   >   - `abandoned <N>` — re-launch the brainstorming chain with plan #N (the number from the list above) as the resume target. I'll point the chain at the existing plan + spec + commit history so it picks up from the next un-done step. Stage stays at 3 until the chain finishes; you'll type `/mo-continue` again afterward and this same handler will route to `completed`.
   >   - `abandoned` — same as above; valid only when there's exactly one plan candidate (the `<N>` is implied)."

5. **On `completed`** — fall through to Step 3.

6. **On `abandoned [<N>]`** — resolve `<N>` to the picked plan file (default to the only candidate when omitted; if multiple candidates and `<N>` is missing or out of range, surface the error and re-prompt). Then find the matching spec by the same git-log-filter pattern applied to `docs/superpowers/specs/*.md`:

   ```bash
   spec_candidates="$(
     {
       git log --diff-filter=AM --name-only --format= "$base_commit..HEAD" -- 'docs/superpowers/specs/*.md' 2>/dev/null
       git status --porcelain -- docs/superpowers/specs/ 2>/dev/null \
         | sed -E 's/^.. //; s/^.*-> //' \
         | grep '\.md$' || true
     } | sort -u
   )"
   ```

   - 0 spec candidates → omit the spec line from the resume primer (the chain works from the plan alone).
   - 1 spec candidate → reference it as `<picked_spec_path>` in the primer.
   - >1 spec candidates → list all of them in the primer; the chain decides which is canonical.

   Reset sub-flow back to `chain-in-progress` (the chain is about to be live again):

   ```bash
   $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh set "sub-flow=chain-in-progress"
   ```

   Then invoke the `brainstorming` Skill with this **resume primer** (substitute literals for the `<...>` placeholders, paste the actual `git log` output where indicated). Substitute `<$data_root>` with the resolved data root (e.g. `millwright-overseer` by default; whatever `$data_root` evaluates to in this command's shell context).

   ```
   I'm RESUMING an interrupted implementation session for the "<active_feature>" feature. The previous session ended mid-chain — some commits were made but the plan isn't fully executed.

   **Required first reads (in order):**

   1. <$data_root>/workflow-stream/<active_feature>/blueprints/current/primer.md — the original stage-3 launch primer (active scope, goals, journal context, likely-relevant skills/rules).
   2. <picked_plan_path> — the plan you wrote in the previous session. Checkbox state (`- [x]` vs `- [ ]`) reflects what's been executed; the next `- [ ]` is where you pick up.
   3. <picked_spec_path> — the spec the plan implements. *(omit this line if no spec candidates were found)*

   **Already shipped** (commits in <base_commit>..HEAD):

   <paste output of `git log --oneline <base_commit>..HEAD` here>

   **Resume strategy:**

   Read the primer, plan, and spec. The plan's checkbox state tells you what was executed; the commit log tells you what physically landed. If they disagree (plan checkboxes can lag if the previous session was killed before the check was written), reconcile based on the commits — they're authoritative. Then continue executing-plans / subagent-driven-development from the next un-done Task or Step.

   If the plan is fundamentally incompatible with what's been committed (e.g., the previous session diverged and the plan is now stale), surface that to the overseer; they can run `/mo-abort-workflow` to start over. Otherwise: resume execution.

   Do NOT worry about the mo-workflow — when you finish, the overseer types `/mo-continue` to resume mo-workflow at stage 4.
   ```

   After invoking the Skill, **stop here**. Do NOT advance the stage. Do NOT mark `implementation-completed`. The stage stays at 3, sub-flow at `chain-in-progress`. The overseer drives the chain to completion (same isolation model as the original stage-3 launch); when it finishes, they type `/mo-continue` and this handler runs again, this time routing to `completed` (or back through Step 2.5 if the second run was also interrupted).

### Resume Step 3 — Drift prompt (skipped when probe set the marker)

(Skipped when `active.drift-check-completed` was set true by Step 0's probe.)

```bash
drift_marker_now="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh get drift-check-completed 2>/dev/null || echo 'false')"
if [[ "$drift_marker_now" != "true" ]]; then
  # Existing overseer prompt and dispatch lives below in "Resume Step 4 — Blueprint drift check".
  drift_prompt_required=1
else
  echo "Resume Step 3: drift marker already true (set by Step 0 probe); skipping drift prompt."
  drift_prompt_required=0
fi
```

### Resume Step 4 — Blueprint drift check (overseer-driven)

(Skipped when `drift_prompt_required==0`, i.e., the Step 0 probe already set the marker for this cycle.)

Brainstorming may have surfaced new requirements, dropped some, or shifted scope mid-session. Without inspecting the chain's spec/plan files (mo-workflow doesn't read those), the overseer is the authority on whether `blueprints/current/requirements.md` still matches what was actually built.

When `drift_prompt_required==1`, prompt the overseer:

> "Stage-4 drift check: did anything in the requirements change during brainstorming? Reply:
>
>   - `<short reason>` — I'll run `/mo-update-blueprint --reason-kind=spec-update <reason>` to rotate `blueprints/current/` into history and regenerate `requirements.md` / `config.md` / `diagrams/` from the **implementation** (codebase + `base-commit..HEAD` diff) plus the just-rotated history version. The previous blueprint's `todo-item-ids`, `## Planned`, `## Non-goals`, `## GIT BRANCH`, and `## Overseer Additions` are preserved verbatim. The active quest cycle's `todo-list.md` and `summary.md` (under `quest/<slug>/`) and `journal/` are NOT consulted.
>   - `continue` — proceed without updating the blueprint. Any drift will surface as findings during overseer review.
>
> Skipping is fine — the review loop catches drift via `re-spec` / `re-plan` findings if needed."

```bash
if [[ "${drift_prompt_required:-0}" == "1" ]]; then
  # Wait for the overseer's reply, captured into $drift_reply by the LLM.
  if [[ "$drift_reply" != "continue" && -n "$drift_reply" ]]; then
    # Drift side effect: invoke /mo-update-blueprint with --reason-kind=spec-update.
    # The --reason-kind=spec-update tag is what makes the Step 0 probe detect this
    # cycle's drift on retry (it walks history versions K > history-baseline-version
    # for kind=spec-update).
    /mo-update-blueprint --reason-kind=spec-update "$drift_reply"
  fi
  # Split marker write — runs whether the overseer continued or supplied a reason.
  # Splitting it from the side effect closes F1 (a session break between
  # /mo-update-blueprint's return and this line is recovered by the Step 0 probe
  # on the next /mo-continue).
  $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh set "drift-check-completed=true"
fi
```

### Resume Step 5 — Generate implementation diagrams

Run `/mo-draw-diagrams` (the user-facing wrapper around `mo-generate-implementation-diagrams`). The command renders the diagram set of `base-commit..HEAD` into `implementation/diagrams/`, framing pre-existing participants/classes/flows as shaded context next to the new functionality.

### Resume Step 6 — Create overseer-review skeleton

Initialize the overseer-review skeleton (idempotent — `review.sh init` refuses to overwrite, so skip the call if the file already exists). The stage advance is deferred to Step 7 so the whole resume sequence finalizes atomically.

```bash
data_root="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/data-root.sh)"
ov_file="$data_root/workflow-stream/$active_feature/implementation/overseer-review.md"
[[ -f "$ov_file" ]] || $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/review.sh init "$active_feature"
```

### Resume Step 7 — Final atomic advance-to (3 → 5, sub-flow=none)

The Resume Handler eliminates stage 4 as a persisted state. The atomic `advance-to 3 5 --set sub-flow=none` collapses the old "advance 3 then advance 4" pair into a single transition, so a session break inside the handler can never strand the workflow at stage 4 with sub-flow=resuming.

```bash
$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh advance-to 3 5 --set sub-flow=none
```

Tell the overseer:

> "Stage 5 — ready for your review. Look at: commits `$base_commit..HEAD` and diagrams under `implementation/diagrams` (existing-system context is shaded grey; new functionality is highlighted). Write your findings into `implementation/overseer-review.md` (or leave it empty to approve). Type `/mo-continue` when done."

Stop here.

---

## Overseer Handler (current-stage = 5)

Runs after the overseer has reviewed the implementation and either filled `overseer-review.md` with findings or left it empty.

### Overseer Step 1 — Verify overseer-review.md exists

```bash
data_root="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/data-root.sh)"
ov_file="$data_root/workflow-stream/$active_feature/implementation/overseer-review.md"
[[ -f "$ov_file" ]] || {
  echo "overseer-review.md not found — did you mean to approve with no findings?" >&2
  read -p "Create empty overseer-review.md and approve? (y/n): " ans
  [[ "$ans" == "y" ]] || exit 1
  $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/review.sh init "$active_feature"
}
```

### Overseer Step 1.5 — Canonicalize free-form findings

The overseer is encouraged to write findings as plain sentences — one per line or paragraph — under `## Implementation Review`. Before checking for open findings, normalize the file so every finding is in `### IR-NNN — ...` block format. Without this step, a free-form finding would slip past `list-open` (which only matches structured `### IR-NNN` headings with a `- status: open` line) and the workflow would silently auto-finalize as "approved with no findings."

```bash
unstructured="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/review.sh canonicalize "$active_feature" || true)"
canon_exit=$?
```

`canonicalize` exits `0` (already canonical — skip to Step 2), `3` (unstructured spans found — proceed below), or non-zero (error — surface and abort). When spans are found, `stdout` carries one TSV row per span: `<line-start>\t<line-end>\t<flattened-text>`.

For each TSV row, the millwright (the LLM, not the script) classifies and converts:

1. **Read the text snippet.** Use it as the basis for the structured block's summary and details.
2. **Classify severity** (default `major`):
   - `blocker` if the text contains absolute language (`must`, `critical`, `breaks`, `required`, `cannot ship`).
   - `minor` if the text is hedged (`nit`, `prefer`, `could`, `maybe`, `optional`).
   - `major` otherwise.
3. **Classify scope** (default `re-implement` for refactoring suggestions, `fix` for small patches):
   - `fix` — small patch (typo, edge case, single-line behavior change, missing test).
   - `re-implement` — refactoring an existing module without changing the spec ("move to common folder", "rename", "extract", "should be generic").
   - `re-plan` — adds tasks not in the original plan ("also add X", "wire up Y", "missing handler for Z").
   - `re-spec` — challenges the design ("wrong abstraction", "should use a different pattern", "this approach won't scale").
4. **Generate a one-line summary** (≤ 80 chars) capturing the finding's intent.
5. **Add the structured block:**
   ```bash
   echo "<full original text>" | $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/review.sh add \
     "$active_feature" "<severity>" "<scope>" "<summary>"
   ```
   The original text becomes the block's `details:` body so the overseer's wording is preserved verbatim.
6. **Strip the original freeform span.** After all spans have been added, call `strip-freeform` for each one **in reverse line order** (highest line first) so earlier line numbers stay valid:
   ```bash
   $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/review.sh strip-freeform "$active_feature" <line-start> <line-end>
   ```

When all spans are converted, tell the overseer:

> "I converted **N** free-form finding(s) into `### IR-NNN` blocks. Severity and scope are my classifications — open `overseer-review.md` to override before the review session begins. Continuing to review..."

Then fall through to Step 2 (which re-runs `list-open` and now sees the freshly-added structured findings).

### Overseer Step 2 — Check for open findings

```bash
open_ids="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/review.sh list-open "$active_feature")"
```

### Overseer Step 3a — No findings

If `open_ids` is empty:

```bash
$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh advance-to 5 7 \
  --set sub-flow=none \
  --set overseer-review-completed=true
```

The single `advance-to 5 7 --set ...` collapses the no-findings approve path's stage advances and the `overseer-review-completed=true` write into one atomic transition (Item 4 of the v11 plan). A session break inside this block can never strand the workflow at stage 6 with sub-flow=none — either everything lands or nothing does.

Tell the overseer: "Approved — no findings. Auto-finalizing via `/mo-complete-workflow`."

Then auto-invoke `/mo-complete-workflow` immediately. Do not wait for a further overseer signal — the loop's clean exit is itself the trigger.

### Overseer Step 3b — Findings present

Hand the review off to a **brainstorming review session** by invoking `/mo-review`. The session runs **isolated from mo-workflow — same isolation model as stage 3**. After invoking `/mo-review`, control returns to the overseer, who drives the session through to its terminal state (typing `approve`).

```bash
# /mo-review handles sub-flow=reviewing, the stage 5→6 advance, and the Skill invocation,
# then hands off. It does NOT block on the Skill.
/mo-review
```

After `/mo-review` returns, **stop**. Do not advance the stage. Do not auto-fire `/mo-complete-workflow`. The Review-Resume Handler will run when the overseer types `/mo-continue` again after the brainstorming review session exits.

Tell the overseer: "Brainstorming review session is now live (isolated from mo-workflow). Drive it to completion (typing `approve` when ready), then type `/mo-continue` to resume the mo-workflow."

**Why no scope-tier dispatch here.** Earlier versions of mo-workflow encoded a scope-tier cascade (re-spec → re-plan → re-implement → fix) inside this handler. That logic moved into the brainstorming session itself: the chain reads each finding's `scope:` as a hint and chooses the smallest cascade that resolves the root cause. Mo-workflow no longer needs to know about scopes during the loop — only that brainstorming exited cleanly.

**No iteration cap.** Brainstorming controls its own loop; the overseer ends it by typing `approve`. If the overseer accumulates many findings and the loop runs long, it's their judgment call to interrupt with `/mo-abort-workflow`.

---

## Review-Resume Handler (current-stage = 6, sub-flow = reviewing)

Runs after the brainstorming review session has fully exited and returned control. Sanity-checks the findings status, advances 6 → 7, and auto-fires `/mo-complete-workflow`.

This handler exists because stage 6's brainstorming review session runs **isolated from mo-workflow** — same as the stage-3 chain. There is no programmatic signal that the session ended; the overseer's `/mo-continue` is the explicit resumption signal.

### Review-Resume Step 1 — Open-findings completion check

```bash
remaining_open="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/review.sh list-open "$active_feature")"
```

If `remaining_open` is empty, fall through to Step 2 (advance and finalize).

If `remaining_open` is non-empty, the review session ended without resolving every finding — the same ambiguity as the stage-3 abandoned-chain case. The session may have exited cleanly with deferred findings, or it may have been interrupted mid-loop. Prompt the overseer:

> "Review session ended with **N** open finding(s): `<id-list>`. Did the session finish, or was it interrupted?
>
>   - `completed` — keep them open and proceed; the workflow advances 6 → 7 with the finding(s) still `open`. Use this if you and the chain agreed to defer them. `mo-complete-workflow` archives `overseer-review.md` into `blueprints/history/v[N]/implementation/` at stage 8, so the deferred findings remain queryable in the historical record. (If you want them *addressed* in this cycle instead of just archived, run `/mo-review` to re-launch the loop.)
>   - `abandoned` — re-launch the brainstorming review session via `/mo-review` to address the remaining findings. Stage stays at 6 until the session exits cleanly; you'll type `/mo-continue` again afterward.
>   - `abort` — cancel the workflow via `/mo-abort-workflow`."

- **On `completed`** — fall through to Step 2.
- **On `abandoned`** — invoke `/mo-review` (which reads the open findings, prompts for a review-mode, and re-launches the loop) and **stop**. Do NOT advance past stage 6. The next `/mo-continue` after the new session exits will re-enter this handler.
- **On `abort`** — invoke `/mo-abort-workflow` and stop.

### Review-Resume Step 2 — (deferred to Step 2.6 finalize)

`sub-flow=reviewing` stays in place until after the diagram-refresh prompt at Step 2.5 (Item 4 of the v11 plan). This makes the refresh prompt re-fireable on retry — if a session break happens between "overseer answered the prompt" and "rotation finalized," the next `/mo-continue` re-enters this handler and re-prompts (the overseer can answer the same way; the prompt is idempotent because no state changed yet).

### Review-Resume Step 2.5 — Offer diagram refresh

The review session may have committed new code. The implementation diagrams under `implementation/diagrams/` reflect the state at the post-chain Resume Handler — they don't capture review-loop fixes. Before finalizing, give the overseer the option to refresh:

```bash
data_root="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/data-root.sh)"
review_commits="$(git rev-list --count "$base_commit..HEAD" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)"
diagram_commits="$(git log --format=%H -- "$data_root/workflow-stream/$active_feature/implementation/diagrams/" | head -1)"
new_since_diagrams="$(git rev-list --count "${diagram_commits:-$base_commit}..HEAD" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)"
```

Prompt the overseer:

> "The review session committed **N** additional commits since the original implementation diagrams were generated. Regenerate the diagrams to reflect the final state of `base-commit..HEAD`?
>
>   - `y` — re-run `/mo-draw-diagrams` before finalizing (~30 seconds; useful so the final snapshot reflects the review-loop fixes before stage 8 archives the diagrams into `blueprints/history/v[N+1]/implementation/diagrams/`).
>   - `n` — proceed directly to `/mo-complete-workflow`. The diagrams stay at the post-chain snapshot; they'll be archived as-is (not deleted) at stage 8.
>
> (y/n)"

Skip the prompt entirely when `new_since_diagrams == 0` (no review-loop commits — diagrams are already current). On `y`, invoke `/mo-draw-diagrams` and continue. On `n`, continue. Either way, fall through to Step 2.6.

### Review-Resume Step 2.6 — Atomic finalize (advance-to 6 → 7)

After the refresh prompt has been answered (or skipped), finalize the review-resume sequence in one atomic write. This collapses the old "set sub-flow=none + set overseer-review-completed=true + advance 6" trio into a single transition (Item 4 of the v11 plan), so a session break here cannot strand the workflow at stage 6 with sub-flow=none and the marker only half-set.

```bash
$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh advance-to 6 7 \
  --set sub-flow=none \
  --set overseer-review-completed=true
```

### Review-Resume Step 3 — Auto-fire /mo-complete-workflow

Tell the overseer: "Overseer-review session approved. Auto-finalizing via `/mo-complete-workflow`."

Then auto-invoke `/mo-complete-workflow` immediately. Do not wait for a further overseer signal — the third `/mo-continue` is itself the trigger.

## Notes

- `/mo-continue` is a dispatcher — it reads state and acts. It never asks the overseer which stage we're at.
- For state outside the known stages (3, 5, or 6+reviewing), the dispatcher falls through to `/mo-resume-workflow` for diagnosis rather than erroring out.
- The mo-workflow does not read or modify the chain's spec/plan files under `docs/superpowers/` in the happy path. Re-entry into `brainstorming` / `writing-plans` / `executing-plans` for `re-spec` / `re-plan` cascades is via concern-bundle primers; the chain regenerates its own artefacts internally and produces fresh commits in `base-commit..HEAD`. **The single exception** is the abandoned-chain recovery branch in Resume Step 2.5, which reads the chain's plan and spec **read-only** to compose a resume primer when the overseer reports an interrupted run. No mo-workflow command writes to `docs/superpowers/`.
- Both the stage-3 chain and the stage-6 brainstorming review session run **isolated from mo-workflow**. Neither auto-detects skill completion — the explicit `/mo-continue` from the overseer is the resumption signal in both cases.
- If invariants are violated (e.g., `current-stage=4` but `implementation-completed=false`), stop and recommend `/mo-resume-workflow` for diagnosis.
