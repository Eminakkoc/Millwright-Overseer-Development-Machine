description: Finalize the active feature's workflow — archive blueprints, clear implementation, advance the queue. Stage 8.
---

# mo-complete-workflow

**Stage 8 finalizer.** Archives the blueprint into `history/`, clears the implementation folder, resets `progress.md`, and advances the workflow queue to the next feature.

## Invocation

The millwright auto-invokes this command on **stage-7 clean exit** — that is, immediately after the `/mo-continue` handler sets `overseer-review-completed=true` and advances `active.current-stage` to 7. (Stage 8 is conceptual — it names the finalizer phase but is not a persisted `active.current-stage` value; this command's `progress.sh finish` call sets `active=null` rather than incrementing the stage counter to 8.) The overseer does **not** type `/mo-complete-workflow` in the happy path; reaching stage 7 is itself the signal.

The command remains manually invokable for recovery — e.g. when `/mo-resume-workflow` recommends it because an auto-fire was interrupted.

## Preconditions

- `overseer-review-completed` is `true` in `progress.md` (stage 7 has exited clean).

## Execution

### Step 0 — Top-of-command branch dispatch

Before running the normal forward path, check for in-flight rotation states (a prior `/mo-complete-workflow` invocation may have been interrupted) and post-finish recovery states (the rotation completed but Step 7 housekeeping was interrupted). Four branches (one of which is the normal path):

```bash
data_root="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/data-root.sh)"
active_feature="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh get-active 2>/dev/null || echo 'null')"

# Helper: read latest finalized v[N] under a feature's history.
latest_finalized_version() {
  local feat="$1"
  local hist="$data_root/workflow-stream/$feat/blueprints/history"
  [[ -d "$hist" ]] || { echo ""; return; }
  ls -d "$hist"/v[0-9]* 2>/dev/null \
    | grep -vE '\.(partial|partial\.tmp)$' \
    | sed -n 's|.*/v\([0-9]\+\)$|\1|p' \
    | sort -n | tail -1
}

# Helper: read latest finalized v[N]/reason.md.kind.
latest_reason_kind() {
  local feat="$1"
  local v
  v="$(latest_finalized_version "$feat")"
  [[ -n "$v" ]] || { echo ""; return; }
  $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/frontmatter.sh get \
    "$data_root/workflow-stream/$feat/blueprints/history/v${v}/reason.md" kind \
    2>/dev/null || echo ""
}

# Helper: count partial directories for a feature; print the single one if exactly one exists.
single_partial() {
  local feat="$1"
  local hist="$data_root/workflow-stream/$feat/blueprints/history"
  [[ -d "$hist" ]] || { echo ""; return; }
  local matches
  matches=$(ls -d "$hist"/v[0-9]*.partial 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
  if [[ "$matches" == "1" ]]; then
    ls -d "$hist"/v[0-9]*.partial 2>/dev/null
  fi
}
```

**Branch 0a — in-flight rotation matching completion.** If `active != null` AND there is exactly one `v[K].partial/` for `active.feature` AND its `reason.md.kind == "completion"`, the prior invocation crashed mid-rotation. Resume the rotation, skip Steps 1–4, and proceed to Step 5 onward. (Step 5 archival uses `mv -n` and is already idempotent — re-entry picks up cleanly even when Step 5 landed some artifacts before the prior crash.)

```bash
if [[ "$active_feature" != "null" && -n "$active_feature" ]]; then
  partial_dir="$(single_partial "$active_feature")"
  if [[ -n "$partial_dir" ]]; then
    partial_kind="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/frontmatter.sh get "$partial_dir/reason.md" kind 2>/dev/null || echo "")"
    if [[ "$partial_kind" == "completion" ]]; then
      version="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/blueprints.sh resume-partial "$active_feature" --expected-kind completion)"
      echo "Resumed in-flight completion rotation: history/v${version}/"
      branch_route="0a"  # remembered so we know to skip Steps 1-4
    elif [[ -n "$partial_kind" ]]; then
      # Branch 0b — different-kind partial blocks completion rotation.
      echo "error: completion rotation refused — a $partial_kind rotation is already partial at $partial_dir." >&2
      echo "Finish or abandon that rotation first (run the command that owns its kind, or repair manually)." >&2
      exit 1
    fi
  fi
fi
```

**Branch I — post-finish recovery (active=null).** If `active == null` AND `progress.completed` is non-empty AND the latest finalized history version for `completed[-1]` has `reason.kind == "completion"`, then rotation + `progress.sh finish` ran but the housekeeping (Step 7) was interrupted. Reconstruct `active_feature` from `completed[-1]` and `remaining` from the queue, skip Steps 1–6, and run Step 7 only. Do NOT call `progress.sh get` for active fields in this branch (active is null).

```bash
if [[ "$active_feature" == "null" || -z "$active_feature" ]]; then
  completed_last="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh queue-remaining 2>/dev/null >/dev/null; \
    python3 -c "
import sys, re, yaml
with open('$data_root/quest/active.md') as f:
    slug = yaml.safe_load(f.read().split('---')[1]).get('slug')
import os
prog = '$data_root/quest/' + slug + '/progress.md'
with open(prog) as f:
    fm = yaml.safe_load(f.read().split('---')[1])
completed = fm.get('completed') or []
print(completed[-1] if completed else '')
")"
  if [[ -n "$completed_last" ]]; then
    last_kind="$(latest_reason_kind "$completed_last")"
    if [[ "$last_kind" == "completion" ]]; then
      active_feature="$completed_last"
      branch_route="I"
      echo "Branch I: post-finish recovery for $active_feature; running Step 7 housekeeping only."
    fi
  fi
  if [[ "${branch_route:-}" != "I" ]]; then
    echo "error: /mo-complete-workflow requires an active feature, but progress.md.active is null and no Branch I recovery condition was met. Run /mo-continue or /mo-resume-workflow for diagnosis." >&2
    exit 1
  fi
fi

# Verify overseer-review-completed only on the normal path (Branches 0a, II, III need it;
# Branch I has active=null so the guard is skipped).
if [[ "${branch_route:-III}" != "I" ]]; then
  oc="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh get overseer-review-completed 2>/dev/null || echo 'false')"
  [[ "$oc" == "true" ]] || { echo "error: overseer-review not complete; run /mo-continue first" >&2; exit 1; }
fi
```

**Branch II — in-flight rotation already done (active!=null, finalized vN/).** If `active != null` AND `blueprints/current/requirements.md` is missing AND the latest finalized history version for `active.feature` has `reason.kind == "completion"`, the rotation completed but Step 5 (or later) was interrupted. Set `$version=N` and proceed Step 5 → 6 → 7.

```bash
if [[ "${branch_route:-}" == "" && "$active_feature" != "null" ]]; then
  if [[ ! -f "$data_root/workflow-stream/$active_feature/blueprints/current/requirements.md" ]]; then
    last_kind="$(latest_reason_kind "$active_feature")"
    if [[ "$last_kind" == "completion" ]]; then
      version="$(latest_finalized_version "$active_feature")"
      branch_route="II"
      echo "Branch II: rotation already done at history/v${version}/; resuming from Step 5."
    fi
  fi
fi
```

**Branch III — normal forward path.** Falls through to Step 1 below. Before Step 4's completion rotate, the normal path runs `blueprints.sh check-current --require-primer "$active_feature"` and requires `0` (completion rotation must never archive a current/ tree that is missing the stage-3 primer; see Item 9 of the v11 progress-gap plan).

### Step 1 — Resolve inputs

(Skipped when `branch_route` is `0a`, `I`, or `II`.)

```bash
if [[ "${branch_route:-III}" == "III" ]]; then
  : "${active_feature:?already resolved above}"

  # Verify overseer-review-completed (re-checked here for the normal path).
  oc="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh get overseer-review-completed)"
  [[ "$oc" == "true" ]] || { echo "error: overseer-review not complete; run /mo-continue first" >&2; exit 1; }
fi
```

The chain's plan / spec files under `docs/superpowers/` are not touched by this command — those artefacts belong to the brainstorming chain, not the mo-workflow. Cross-referencing between requirements and commits lives in `requirements.md`'s `commits:` field (populated below).

### Step 2 — Transition todos IMPLEMENTING → IMPLEMENTED

(Skipped on Branch I — the prior invocation already ran this before the housekeeping interruption.)

```bash
if [[ "${branch_route:-III}" == "III" || "${branch_route:-}" == "0a" || "${branch_route:-}" == "II" ]]; then
  $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/todo.sh bulk-transition IMPLEMENTING IMPLEMENTED --feature "$active_feature"
fi
```

The `--feature` filter scopes the transition to items under the active feature's section header only, so sibling features still mid-flight in a multi-feature queue are not touched.

### Step 3 — Populate commits in requirements.md

(Skipped on Branch I.)

```bash
if [[ "${branch_route:-III}" == "III" || "${branch_route:-}" == "0a" || "${branch_route:-}" == "II" ]]; then
  $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/commits.sh populate-requirements "$active_feature"
fi
```

### Step 4 — Rotate blueprints/current → history/v[N+1]

(Only runs on Branch III. Branch 0a's `version` was set by `blueprints.sh resume-partial`; Branch II's `version` was set by the Branch II detection.)

```bash
if [[ "${branch_route:-III}" == "III" ]]; then
  # Preflight (Item 9 + Item 6): completion rotate must NEVER archive a current/
  # tree that is missing the stage-3 primer. Refuse with a diagnostic if so.
  if "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/blueprints.sh" check-current --require-primer "$active_feature"; then
    cc_status=0
  else
    cc_status=$?
  fi
  if [[ "$cc_status" != "0" ]]; then
    echo "error: blueprints/current is incomplete (check-current --require-primer returned $cc_status). Completion rotation refused — repair current/ (regenerate primer.md, ensure all artifacts validate) before re-running /mo-complete-workflow." >&2
    exit 1
  fi
  version="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/blueprints.sh rotate "$active_feature" \
    --reason-kind completion \
    --reason-summary "completed at stage 8 for $active_feature")"
  echo "Blueprints archived into history/v${version}"
fi
```

### Step 5 — Archive implementation/ into the rotated history version

(Skipped on Branch I. Idempotent for Branch 0a re-entry — `mv -n` refuses to overwrite, so artifacts already moved on a prior partial run stay put.)

Stage 4 rotated `blueprints/current/` into `blueprints/history/v${version}/`. The just-finished implementation artifacts (`overseer-review.md`, `review-context.md`, `change-summary.md`, and `diagrams/`) are part of the same audit record, so move them into a sibling `implementation/` subfolder under the new history version. This preserves every finding (including any `status: open` ones the overseer chose to defer) and the diagrams of `base-commit..HEAD` for posterity. The live `implementation/` folder is then empty and the next feature's stage-2 launcher re-creates children there.

```bash
if [[ "${branch_route:-III}" == "III" || "${branch_route:-}" == "0a" || "${branch_route:-}" == "II" ]]; then
  impl_dir="$data_root/workflow-stream/$active_feature/implementation"
  archive_dir="$data_root/workflow-stream/$active_feature/blueprints/history/v${version}/implementation"
  mkdir -p "$archive_dir"

  # Move each artifact if it exists. Using `mv -n` keeps it idempotent if the
  # command is re-invoked after a partial run; mv would otherwise refuse to
  # overwrite an existing target.
  for artifact in overseer-review.md review-context.md change-summary.md; do
    [[ -e "$impl_dir/$artifact" ]] && mv -n "$impl_dir/$artifact" "$archive_dir/$artifact"
  done
  [[ -d "$impl_dir/diagrams" ]] && mv -n "$impl_dir/diagrams" "$archive_dir/diagrams"
  # Leave the implementation/ folder itself in place (empty) — next workflow re-creates children.
fi
```

The historical snapshot is then complete: `blueprints/history/v${version}/` carries the rotated `requirements.md`, `config.md`, `diagrams/`, `primer.md`, `reason.md`, AND `implementation/` (review file, review-context, change-summary, implementation diagrams). PMs querying past cycles can read the full audit trail from this single folder per feature-version.

### Step 6 — Finish the active feature

(Skipped on Branch I — `progress.sh finish` already ran in the prior invocation that left active=null. Re-running it would error: require_active rejects null active.)

Archive the active feature into `completed` and set `active` to null. Under the two-step activation model, `/mo-apply-impact` will activate the next feature from the queue when it's invoked next.

```bash
if [[ "${branch_route:-III}" == "III" || "${branch_route:-}" == "0a" || "${branch_route:-}" == "II" ]]; then
  $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh finish >/dev/null
fi
remaining="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/progress.sh queue-remaining 2>/dev/null || echo '')"
```

### Step 7 — Report and auto-continue

(Runs on every branch including Branch I — this is the housekeeping that Branch I exists to recover.)

If `remaining` is empty, check whether unmarked TODO items still exist in the cycle's `todo-list.md`. If so, the overseer can extend this cycle by marking more items rather than running `/mo-run` from scratch:

```bash
todo_count="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/todo.sh list TODO 2>/dev/null | sed '/^$/d' | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
```

- **If `todo_count > 0`:**

  Resolve the active quest's todo-list path for the user-facing message:

  ```bash
  active_quest_dir="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/quest.sh dir)"
  ```

  > "Workflow for `$active_feature` complete. Queue is now empty, but **$todo_count items still in `[ ] TODO`** state in `$active_quest_dir/todo-list.md`. To continue this cycle, mark the items you want next (`[x] (assignee) TODO — ...`) and type `/mo-continue` — I'll promote them to PENDING, enqueue their features, and resume from stage 1.5. Or run `/mo-run <folders> --archive-active` to retire this cycle (preserved as a historical subfolder under `quest/`) and start a brand-new one."

  Stop here; the Pre-flight Handler in `mo-continue.md` (active=null, queue_count=0, `[x] TODO` lines present) takes over once the overseer marks items and types `/mo-continue`. It uses `progress.sh enqueue` to repopulate the queue without calling `progress.sh init` (which would refuse because `progress.md` already exists). The active-quest pointer stays `active`; this is still the same cycle.

- **If `todo_count == 0`:**

  The cycle is fully complete — every item the overseer marked has shipped, and nothing else is queued. Archive the active-quest pointer so a fresh `/mo-run` can open a new cycle without `--archive-active`. The cycle's subfolder under `quest/<slug>/` stays intact as a historical record.

  ```bash
  finished_slug="$($CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/quest.sh current 2>/dev/null || echo "")"
  $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/quest.sh end
  ```

  > "Workflow for `$active_feature` complete. Queue empty and no TODO items remain. Cycle `$finished_slug` is now archived (subfolder preserved under `quest/$finished_slug/` for future reference). Run `/mo-run <folders>` for a new cycle."

  Stop here; nothing else to do.

If `remaining` is non-empty, the first line is the next feature (soft announce-and-continue):

```bash
next="$(printf '%s\n' "$remaining" | head -1)"
```

> "Workflow for $active_feature complete. Next in queue: $next. Proceeding automatically — interrupt now or run `/mo-abort-workflow` to pause."

Then, without waiting for a further overseer reply, auto-invoke `/mo-apply-impact`. It will call `progress.sh activate` internally, which pops `$next` into the `active` block and starts stage 2 for it. If the overseer interrupts with a non-affirmative message before or during stage 2 execution, defer to their instruction. Manual `/mo-apply-impact` invocation remains available.
