# Coverage policy: this hook validates LIVE workflow artifacts only — files
# under `quest/`, `blueprints/current/`, and `implementation/`. Files under
# `blueprints/history/v*/` are an audit archive: they are produced by
# `blueprints.sh rotate` and `mo-complete-workflow`'s implementation-archival
# step via shell `mv` (no Edit/Write tool call, so the hook would not fire
# even if a case matched), and once rotated they are expected to be
# immutable. Their content was validated when they lived in `current/` or
# `implementation/`. The single exception is `blueprints/history/v*/reason.md`,
# which IS written by the rotation step via `frontmatter.sh init` and
# therefore must be schema-checked. The archived `implementation/` artifacts
# (`overseer-review.md`, `review-context.md`, `change-summary.md`,
# `diagrams/`) under `blueprints/history/v*/implementation/` follow the same
# "validated when live, immutable once archived" rule as the rotated
# blueprint files. If you ever need to edit a historical artifact by hand,
# run the validator manually — the hook intentionally does not gate that
# path.
