#!/usr/bin/env bash
# quest.sh — manage the active-quest pointer at quest/active.md.
#
# The quest folder is per-cycle: each /mo-run creates a fresh subfolder
# (named after a date-prefixed slug derived from the journal folders)
# and writes todo-list.md, summary.md, progress.md, and queue-rationale.md
# inside it. Historical cycle folders are preserved as a permanent task
# archive. The top-level quest/active.md file is the single piece of
# mutable state and tells path-resolution helpers which subfolder is
# the currently-active cycle.
#
# Usage:
#   quest.sh slug <folder1> [<folder2> ...]
#       Compute the canonical slug for the given journal folders and
#       print to stdout. Does not create any files. Used by /mo-run
#       to show the user which slug is about to be created.
#
#   quest.sh start <slug> <folder1> [<folder2> ...]
#       Begin a new cycle: create quest/<slug>/ if missing and write
#       quest/active.md with status=active. Refuses if there is already
#       an active cycle (slug != null AND status=active) — the caller
#       must run `quest.sh end` (or pass /mo-run --archive-active) first.
#
#   quest.sh end
#       End the current cycle: set quest/active.md to slug=null,
#       status=archived. Leaves the per-cycle subfolder intact under
#       quest/<slug>/ for historical querying. Idempotent — safe to call
#       even if no cycle is active.
#
#   quest.sh init-pointer
#       Create quest/active.md with status=none if it doesn't exist.
#       Used by /mo-init to scaffold a fresh workspace.
#
#   quest.sh current
#       Print the active slug to stdout, or empty if none.
#       Exit 0 if a cycle is active, 1 if not.
#
#   quest.sh dir
#       Print the path of the active quest's subfolder, e.g.
#       /path/to/millwright-overseer/quest/2026-04-27-pricing-meeting.
#       Errors if no cycle is active.
#
#   quest.sh has-active
#       Exit 0 if a cycle is active, 1 if not. Silent.
#
#   quest.sh status
#       Print the status field (active|archived|none) or empty if the
#       pointer file is missing.
#
#   quest.sh list
#       List historical quest subfolders, one per line (excluding
#       active.md). Sorted lexicographically (which is also chronological
#       since the slug is date-prefixed).
